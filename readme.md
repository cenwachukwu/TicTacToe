# TicTacToe

This project challenged me to combine my programming skills in JavaScript with my skills in HTML and CSS, to build a game with an interactable user interface.

## Tools Used:

* HTML, CSS & JavaScript
* VS code

## Pseudocode: thought process

1. 3x3 grid box with CSS grid: made use of empty divs and added a pointer cursor with css
1. Add interactivity with JS event listeners: make it clickable, and change colors. Also make it let the player know who's next to play.
1. Show who won: use knowledge of algorithms to find all possible ways to win and implement if with if statements.
1. Use an "if" statement to make the boxs unclickable after each click.

### Acknowledgement

* I'll like to thank my classmates, Josh and Mustapha, for always pointing me in the right direction.
